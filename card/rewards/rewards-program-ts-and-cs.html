If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, you must stop participating in My Starbucks Rewards™.</p><p>My Starbucks Rewards™ is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 18. If you are below the age 18, you may only use My Starbucks Rewards™ under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.</p><p>Please read the <a href="../../about-us/company-information/online-policies/privacy-statement.html" shape="rect">Privacy Policy</a> carefully to understand how TSPL collects, uses and discloses information about its customers.</p><h3>My Starbucks Rewards™ Program</h3><h3>Program Overview</h3><p>My Starbucks Rewards™ is one way in which TSPL endeavours to reward and thank loyal customers for patronizing TSPL products at Starbucks stores in India.</p><p>To enroll in My Starbucks Rewards™ and receive program benefits, you will first need to create an account. There are multiple ways to enroll in My Starbucks Rewards™ and begin accumulating stars:</p><ol><li><p>If you have a physical Starbucks Card, or Starbucks e-Card, visit  <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/" target="_blank">rewards/index.html</a>. Follow the prompts to create an account and register at least one (1) activated Starbucks Card, or Starbucks e-Card. “Activation” means that you have loaded a minimum of INR 200 (Rupees Two Hundred Only) onto your Starbucks Card for the first time. The minimum balance required to activate a Starbucks Card, or Starbucks e-Card INR 200 (Rupees Two Hundred Only).</p></li><li><p>Download the Starbucks India mobile app to your Android or iPhone device. Follow the prompts to create an account and register with a Starbucks Card or Starbucks e-Card.</p></li></ol><p>The registration process may require that you provide the following information using the online registration form: username, password, email address (required in order to receive all eligible rewards), Starbucks Card number or Starbucks e-Card number, and card security code (CSC), birthday month, name, and postal address, contact number, etc. All of your Starbucks Cards and Starbucks e-Cards activated in India can be registered for use in My Starbucks Rewards™ under these Terms and Conditions. For ease of reference, in these Terms and Conditions, the term “Starbucks Card” refers to a Starbucks Card – physical or digital/virtual (Starbucks e-Card) – that may be activated in India only, either online or at a Starbucks store in India, and the term “activated, registered Starbucks Card” refers to a Starbucks Card that has been activated in India only with an initial card load amount of INR 200 (Rupees Two Hundred Only) and registered to your Starbucks Card account at  <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/" target="_blank">rewards/index.html</a> or on the Starbucks India mobile app.</p><p>My Starbucks Rewards™ benefits are determined based on the amount you spend at any Starbucks store in India and the number of “stars” that you earn through spending with your registered Starbucks Card(s). A “star” for purposes of My Starbucks Rewards™ means each time you use your registered Starbucks Card to pay for a purchase worth INR 300 (Rupees Three Hundred Only, incl. of taxes) on any food, beverage, merchandise, ready-to-drink (for example - juices, water, etc.) and ready-to-eat (for example packaged foods like chocolates, almonds, cashews, etc.) at a Starbucks store in India. No “star” will be rewarded for purchases made with a registered Starbucks Card in any Starbucks store outside India. For each qualified purchase, you will receive one (1) “star” for any purchase worth INR 300 (Rupees Three Hundred Only, inclusive of all taxes), at any Starbucks store in India, except during limited time promotions when Starbucks may offer “Bonus Stars” on featured products and/or services. stars are for promotional purposes only and have no cash value. You can use any registered Starbucks Card to earn stars for your spending at Starbucks stores in India. Please note that a member can only earn stars accumulated after the activated Starbucks Card is registered at <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/" target="_blank">rewards/index.html</a>. You can manage your account online at  <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/" target="_blank">rewards/index.html</a> or through the Starbucks India mobile app. You can track your rewards by signing into your account at  <a href="https://rewards.starbucks.in/" target="_blank">rewards/index.html</a> or or on the Starbucks India mobile app. Stars will not be credited on any purchase made through third party or delivery platforms.</p><h3>My Starbucks Rewards™ Levels</h3><p>Currently, there are three (3) levels in My Starbucks Rewards™ which are determined by the number of stars that you accumulate in your account over a 12-month period. By creating an account, activating and registering a Starbucks Card, you will be automatically enrolled in My Starbucks Rewards™ at the Welcome Level. Earn at least five (5) stars within the twelve (12) month period following the date you reach Welcome level and you will advance to the Green Level. If you earn at least twenty (20) stars within the 12-month period following the date you reach Green Level, you will qualify for the Gold Level.</p><p>Once you reach a specific level within My Starbucks Rewards™, you will receive the benefits that are applicable to that level only. However, you must continue to accumulate stars in order to maintain your level:</p><ol><li>To maintain the Welcome Level, you must earn at least one (1) new star during each consecutive 12-month period following the date you reach Welcome Level. If you do not obtain one (1) new star in 12 months from the enrolment date, you will no longer be eligible for the Welcome Level benefits of My Starbucks Rewards™ and your star balance will be reset to zero.
<br /><br />
If you earn less than one (1) star in your 12-month anniversary period, you will not receive Welcome Level benefits till the time you earn one (1) star again.
<br /><br />
At the Welcome Level, if you earn five (5) to twenty four (24) stars in your 12-month anniversary period you will be placed at the Green Level, and if you earn twenty five (25) stars in your 12-month anniversary period you will be placed at the Gold Level.</li><li>To maintain the Green Level, you must earn at least five (5) new stars during each consecutive 12-month period following the date you reached the Green Level. If you do not obtain 5 new stars in 12 months, you will be placed at the Welcome Level of My Starbucks Rewards™ and your star balance will be reset to zero.
<br /><br />
At the Green Level, if you earn less than or equal to four (4) stars in your 12-month anniversary period, you will be placed at the Welcome Level.
<br /><br />
At the Green Level, if you earn twenty (20) stars in your 12-month anniversary period you will be placed at the Gold Level.</li><li>To maintain the Gold Level, you must earn at least twenty five (25) new stars during each consecutive 12-month period following the date you reached the Gold Level. If you do not obtain 25 new stars in that 12-month period, you will be placed at the Green Level of My Starbucks Rewards™ and your star balance will be reset to zero.
